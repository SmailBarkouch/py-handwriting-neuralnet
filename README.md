# py_handwriting-tf

A basic implementation of a neural network using tensorflow. These are neural networks used to recognize handwriting, and they were trained using the mnist data set. There are currently two trained (deemphasis on that lmao) models: my-model, my-model2

my-model:
accuracy: 62.32378005981445
loss: 0.09889999777078629

my-model2:
accuracy: 53.890586853027344
loss: 0.10159999877214432
